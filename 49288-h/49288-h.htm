<p class="tb">As you approach Dinosaur National Monument from Jensen,
Utah, you see the mass of Split Mountain and the deep, short
canyons that scar its south slope near the Green River&rsquo;s gorge.
As you cross the National Monument boundary the grand view is lost
and you begin to notice details. The masses of gray shale that seem
to be carelessly piled against the tilted sandstone layers are bare of
vegetation. The ground between the hills and the Green River is
covered with sagebrush and greasewood, while along the river itself
are a few large cottonwood trees and many bushes. A sharp turn
brings a change of scene as your car enters a portal in the wall you
have been following. The pronounced tilt of the rocks becomes more
obvious.</p>
<p>A final steep climb and the visitor center is at hand. This building
encloses a significant part of the Dinosaur Quarry, perhaps the greatest
deposit of fossil dinosaur bones known today. From this quarry
have come many of the dinosaur skeletons that are seen today in our
great museums. After parking, a short walk to the overlook on the
southeast reveals a splendid view of Split Mountain. Between that
broad arch of eroded sandstone and the quarry lie steeply tilted sedimentary
rocks of various compositions and hues. Buff and gray sandstones
that weather into soft shapes are separated by reddish-brown
shale. Directly to the east is a section of varicolored shale whose
pastel pinks, reds, greens, grays, and whites justify the name of &ldquo;rainbow
beds&rdquo; that was given them by geologists. In the upper part of
this section are hard sandstone and limestone layers that resist the
erosive action of wind and water. They stand higher than the softer
shales and form hogbacks that rim Split Mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>One of these layers can be traced across the ravine immediately east
of the parking area into the sandstone ledge that forms the north wall
of the visitor center. This is the famous Dinosaur Ledge.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">The Quarry</span></h2>
<p>The Dinosaur Ledge is famous because here the world&rsquo;s greatest
store of fossil bones of these long extinct reptiles has been uncovered.
Two groups, or orders, of dinosaurs have been discovered, with a number
of different types or kinds somewhat related to each other within
these orders. From the fossil bones, scientists can tell that these
creatures varied greatly in size and habits of living.</p>

<p class="pcap">TILTED ROCK STRATA NEAR THE DINOSAUR QUARRY.</p>
</div>
<p>Some were the size of chickens, others as big as horses, and others
of such gigantic size that no land animal alive today can compare with
them. Some were flesh-eaters as indicated by the size and shape of
their teeth and their long sharp claws. Others were plant-eaters and
again it is the structure of their teeth and feet that tell us this. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
flesh-eaters were two-footed and walked on their hind legs, balancing
themselves with heavy long tails. Their short front legs were used
as clawed-arms for tearing at the flesh of other dinosaurs. Many plant-eaters,
on the contrary, were large, heavy, four-footed beasts, often
with long necks and tails. Many of the dinosaurs were land dwellers,
and many others lived in the great marshes and swamps of the long
Mesozoic (middle life) Era of the earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Though the subclass of reptiles we call dinosaurs lived all through
the Mesozoic Era, those whose fossil bones have been uncovered in
this Dinosaur Quarry are embedded in a stratum of rock called the
Morrison formation. This rock stratum dates from the Jurassic Period
in the middle of the Mesozoic Era.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">The Dinosaurs</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3">FIRST DISCOVERIES</h3>
<p>Today, most of us would recognize a fossil bone for what it is, but
in the 1790&rsquo;s things were different. Isolated legbones, vertebrae, and
teeth of huge reptiles had been dug out of certain sedimentary rocks
of Europe and North America but their scientific importance was little
understood.</p>
<p>These specimens were found by people in all walks of life and it
was natural that their curiosity was greatly aroused. The finders took
the specimens to someone nearby whom they considered more competent
to tell them something about these strange bones and teeth. In
nearly all cases these &ldquo;experts&rdquo; were doctors of medicine. They
studied the fossil specimens and reported on them at regular meetings
of the learned societies of which they were members. It was customary
to put the fossils in the collections of these societies where they
could be studied by other members. In North America most reports
of these early discoveries are found in the <i>Proceedings of the American
Philosophical Society</i> in Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
<p>By 1842 accumulated knowledge of these large reptiles was sufficient
to show that they were distinct from any group then known. This
was first recognized by Sir Richard Owen of the British Museum. It
was he who named the group <i>Dinosauria</i>. The name is made up of
two Greek words: <i>deinos</i> (terrible) plus <i>sauras</i> (lizard).</p>
<p>As knowledge of these unusual reptiles increased through the discovery
of additional types and more complete and better preserved
specimens, it became evident that dinosaurs were neither a single group
of reptiles nor were all of them large. Actually the dinosaurs show
as much diversity in size, body form, and habits as any group of reptiles.
The smallest dinosaur walked on its 2 hind legs like a chicken
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and was about the same size. The largest walked on all 4 legs, was
about 80 feet long, and weighed 30 to 40 tons. As examples of variety
in body form there are the two-footed, flesh-eating <i>Antrodemus</i>,
the armored <i>Stegosaurus</i>, the turtle-like <i>Ankylosaurus</i>, the horned <i>Triceratops</i>,
the huge <i>Apatosaurus</i>, the two-footed vegetarian <i>Camptosaurus</i>,
and the great variety of head forms in the aquatic hadrosaurs.
Although there were two distinct groups, we still retain the term
&ldquo;dinosaur&rdquo; as a convenient name for all of them but qualify it by
saying, flesh-eating dinosaur, plant-eating dinosaur, armored dinosaur,
etc., to indicate the particular type we are talking about. Perhaps you
are wondering how all these ancient creatures are related to reptiles in
general. Where do they fit in the classification system devised to
bring order to this mass of knowledge?</p>
<h3 id="c4">POSITION OF DINOSAURS AMONG REPTILES</h3>
<p>It seems there are several orders of reptiles similar to and closely
related to the dinosaurs. Remains of these reptiles are found in the
sedimentary rocks which contain the earliest known dinosaurs. A
number of them resembled the dinosaurs but do not quite meet the
requirements as far as details of the skeleton are concerned. In the
scheme of classification these orders of reptiles are grouped together
into the subclass <i>Archosauria</i>. This subclass includes the dinosaurs,
crocodiles, and the flying reptiles. The lizards, snakes, turtles, and the
tuatera of New Zealand belong to other subclasses of reptiles which
have been distinct from that of the dinosaurs as far back in geologic
time as we can trace them. The kinship between the dinosaurs and
the small lizards living in the monument today lies only in that both
are reptiles. The only living relatives of the dinosaurs are the alligator
and the crocodile.</p>
<p>The dinosaurs were so numerous, and so dominated the whole of
the Mesozoic Era, that this period of earth history is frequently referred
to as the Age of Reptiles.</p>
<h3 id="c5">GEOLOGIC HISTORY</h3>
<p>The Mesozoic Era began some 200 million years ago and ended
some 60 million years ago. Although many other animals lived during
that era, the dinosaurs were the dominant forms of animal life on
land. The 140 million years of the Mesozoic are divided into geologic
periods named Triassic (the oldest), Jurassic, and Cretaceous (the
most recent). Continental deposits representing each of these periods
have been found in all parts of the world and on all continents.
Dinosaur bones have been found in these deposits&mdash;even in such far-away
places as Australia and the southern tip of South America.

</div>
<p>The oldest known dinosaurs are found in rocks of the Triassic
Period. The smaller of these were chicken-size and the largest were
about as big as kangaroos. All of these Triassic dinosaurs were two-footed.
They can be divided into flesh-eaters and plant-eaters, although
none are believed to have been particularly specialized in their
food habits. In general the flesh-eaters were small, agile, and had
sharp teeth for seizing and overpowering active prey. The plant-eaters
were larger with rather long front legs and small blunt teeth suited
only to cropping vegetation. These plant-eaters are believed to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the Triassic ancestors of the giant marsh-dwelling dinosaurs of the
Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.</p>
<p>A greater variety of dinosaurs lived during the Jurassic Period than
in the Triassic. Both two- and four-footed types were present. The
flesh-eaters remained two-footed but increased in size. <i>Antrodemus</i>,
perhaps the best known, was much bigger than a kangaroo. The
larger plant-eaters weighed from 30 to 40 tons and all were four-footed.
The largest land animals, they lived on dry land and in the
swamps that formed an important part of the Jurassic landscape. The
first of the armored plant-eating dinosaurs, <i>Stegosaurus</i>, inhabited the
dry plains. There were also some smaller, kangaroo-size plant-eaters
that were two-footed.</p>
<p>A wide variety of dinosaur fossils has been found in the rocks of
the Cretaceous Period, the last of the Mesozoic Era. The huge
swamp dwellers still thrived. The flesh-eaters had evolved much
larger types and included 40-foot <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, the largest that ever
lived. All the flesh-eaters walked on their hind legs as did their
predecessors of the Jurassic and Triassic Periods.</p>
<p>New and interesting dinosaurs were present among the flesh-eaters.
Horned forms, somewhat similar to the rhinoceros but much larger,
were common. Also common were the turtle-like ankylosaurs. Perhaps
the oddest and most interesting dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were
the two-footed hadrosaurs. These excellent swimmers had weird head
shapes with complicated skull passages and openings. They were a
very successful group and at least 15 different kinds are known from
the Cretaceous rocks of North America.</p>
<h3 id="c6">WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE</h3>
<p>Ideas about the external appearances of dinosaurs have been developed
after many years of work and study. They are a combination of
the ideas of several people who had studied different specimens of a
single species. Let us review briefly the materials and work necessary
to arrive at a reasonably accurate picture of the body form and
external appearance of these strange reptiles.</p>
<p>The first requirement for arriving at a good idea of the build and
physical attitude of an animal is a nearly entire skeleton. We cannot
have too much of the animal&rsquo;s skeleton missing or we may make a
serious error. But if the left hind leg is missing and we have the
right, we are not seriously handicapped. However, if both hind legs
are missing we must restore them according to a similar animal whose
hind legs are known.</p>
<p>After the nearly entire skeleton has been found it must be collected
with great care. This is a rather involved process and, for some of
the large dinosaurs, 2 or 3 months work may be required. The specimen
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
is first uncovered and the fossil bone is treated with a preservative
such as gum arabic, shellac, or one of the plastics. An accurate
diagram of the specimen as it lies in the rock is made on cross-ruled
paper. A trench 2 or 3 feet wide is then dug around the specimen.
The depth of the trench is determined by the width of the specimen
and the nature of the rock.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/pmg008.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="438" />
<p class="pcap">PUTTING PLASTER CAST ON A FOSSIL BEFORE REMOVING IT FROM THE QUARRY.</p>
</div>
<p>If the specimen is too large to take out in one piece, as most dinosaurs
are, it is divided into sections which are numbered serially as
they are taken out. Each section is bandaged in strips of burlap
dipped in plaster of Paris. After the plaster has set, the section is
turned over and the bottom is sealed with burlap and plaster. The
section is labeled with the appropriate number and the section and
number are shown on the diagram.</p>
<p>When all of the sections have been bandaged and numbered they
are packed in strong wooden boxes and shipped to the laboratory.</p>
<p>The work in the laboratory is more involved than that in the field,
and extreme care must be exercised to be sure that the bones will be
undamaged. In most cases the bones have been broken by natural
causes as they lay in the rock before discovery. All the pieces of each
bone must be thoroughly cleaned and securely cemented together.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
This is a very time-consuming task and for a large dinosaur like
<i>Apatosaurus</i> it requires 3 men 4 or 5 years to complete the task.</p>
<p>After all of the bones are cleaned and cemented together the vertebral
column is laid out in its proper sequence on a sand table. Special
care is exercised to be sure that the vertebrae fit correctly with
each other. In this way the correct curvature of the vertebral column
is determined. The proper relationships of the hip bones and ribs to
the vertebrae, the shoulder blade to the ribs, and elements of the limb
bones to each other are determined in the same manner. All of this
work is necessary to correctly fashion the steel framework which will
support the skeleton when it is placed on exhibition. The results of
this careful work must be the framework of an animal which could, if
living, easily go through the normal activities of life such as securing
food and escaping enemies.</p>
<p>Now that the framework of an animal has been set up so that it
could move about if it had muscles, skin, and life, how do we know
how large the muscles were and where they were placed? It is necessary
to have a thorough knowledge of the muscles of a recent animal
similar to the one we are restoring so that we will know what we are
looking for in the fossil. The areas at which muscles are attached to
bones are called muscle scars and are identified by their rough surfaces.
Often the necessary information can be obtained from publications
which usually represent the work done by graduate students for advanced
degrees. At other times we must make our own investigation.
Thus if we know what muscle we are looking for and the size and
shape of its muscle scar, we can determine whether the muscle is a
spindle-shaped mass or a broad sheet.</p>
<p>After we have determined the size and position of the muscles
which operate the limbs, head, and neck, we have a reasonably accurate
idea of the external form of the animal, but we still know
nothing of the nature of the skin which covered the body. Since
dinosaurs were reptiles, we are obliged to assume that they were covered
with a scaly skin in order to preserve the body moisture. None
of the modern reptiles possess sweat glands in the skin. If they did
not possess a waterproof covering of scales they would die in a few
hours as a result of the loss of body moisture by evaporation through
the skin. It is possible that some of the marsh dwellers like <i>Apatosaurus</i>
had naked skin which was, as in the elephant, nearly an inch
thick. The elephant does not possess sweat glands but the outer half
of its skin is composed entirely of dead cells which form a covering
as waterproof as the scales of today&rsquo;s reptiles.</p>
<p>There have been only a few lucky finds of mummified dinosaurs
which show the impressions of the scales. We know that all lizards
do not possess the same type of scales, and therefore, by analogy, we
cannot assume that the dinosaurs did. Eventually, we will probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
find that the dinosaurs exhibited as great a variety of scale-types as do
today&rsquo;s lizards. As yet we have found nothing in the fossil record
which indicates the color of the dinosaurs. Again, we can only assume
that they exhibited as great a variety of colors as do our lizards.
So also, we assume their body functions were somewhat similar to the
reptiles and other related animals we know today.</p>

<h3 id="c7">TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE</h3>
<p>We know the body temperatures of reptiles vary with that of the
air or water in which they live, as they have no means of internal temperature
control. They are very sluggish when their body temperatures
are low and become more active as these temperatures rise, but
only to a certain point. If the body temperatures of reptiles become
too high, they die in a few minutes.</p>
<p>A group of physiologists from Columbia University spent nearly
2 months in southern Florida experimenting on reptiles. They determined
the rate of rise of body temperatures of large lizards and alligators
of all sizes during exposure to the midday sun. As was expected,
the smaller the reptile the more rapid the rise in body
temperature. Dinosaurs were reptiles so we can make two assumptions:
That their physiology was very similar to that of living reptiles;
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
and that the rate of rise of their body temperatures from exposure to
the sun would follow the principles found for living reptiles.</p>
<p>By applying these principles to the dinosaurs, this group of scientists
calculated that if the great bulk of an <i>Apatosaurus</i> were exposed
to the direct rays of the sun at an air temperature of 110&deg; F. for 36
to 40 hours, its body temperature would rise only 1&deg; F. Therefore,
if these calculations are correct, it is probable that the very size of the
huge dinosaurs operated to maintain a fairly constant body temperature.
Consequently, daily and seasonal temperature changes probably
did not affect the activities of the large dinosaurs. However, the
activities of the small ones may have been affected by the daily range
in temperature.</p>
<h3 id="c8">GIZZARD STONES</h3>
<p>For many years rounded stones with a very high polish have been
found in the sedimentary rocks which contain bones of extinct reptiles.
The polish on these stones is very much higher than could
have been applied by the action of water or wind. Some look as
though they had been polished by a jeweler. Since we cannot attribute
this very high polish to wind or water action, we must seek
another agent.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Protiguanodon.</i> <span class="sc">NOTE GIZZARD STONES INSIDE RIB BASKET. (COURTESY, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Just as chickens swallow fine gravel for their gizzards to aid digestion,
so it is thought that some large dinosaurs swallowed stones for
the same purpose. There is some evidence to support this idea. Several
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
specimens of a group of swimming reptiles, called <i>plesiosaurs</i>,
which swarmed the Jurassic and Cretaceous seas, have been found with
highly polished stones inside the rib basket. Also a mass of highly
polished stones was found similarly associated with one dinosaur,
<i>Protiguanodon</i>, in the Lower Cretaceous rocks of Mongolia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no highly polished stones have been found associated
with the specimens in the Dinosaur Quarry or anywhere in
the quarry. A search of the many publications on dinosaurs has not
turned up any mention of highly polished stones being associated with
any of the many specimens found in North America. Thus the evidence
which we have does not permit us to say that the dinosaurs
found in the quarry did or did not possess gizzard stones.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><br /><span class="small">The Climate, Life, and Landscape of Jurassic Time</span></h2>
<p>The geologists who attempt to reconstruct the geography and
climate of the Jurassic Period first gather all possible facts and try to
fit them together to form a logical pattern. The results are then examined
for weak points and an attempt is made to find field evidence
throwing light on these weak points. The final result represents the
sum of our knowledge at the time but is subject to change as new
facts are obtained. Thus the following outline represents present
thinking that may be changed somewhat by future studies.</p>
<p>The land for miles around the Dinosaur Quarry was a low-lying
desert in early Jurassic time. The mountains you see now had not
yet been formed, and the whole desert area lay close to sea level.
Great restless sand dunes drifted across this level land to form a
blanket 700 feet thick. As the earth&rsquo;s crust sank, these dunes were
covered by a long arm of an arctic sea that extended southward along
the present trend of the Rocky Mountains across Canada, Montana,
Wyoming, and Utah. Millions of years later, in late Jurassic time,
when the Morrison formation was deposited, the area rose again and
the stage was set for the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Imagine if you can, the vast plains extending from Mexico to Canada
and from central Utah to the Mississippi River. To the west were
high mountains in the Great Basin region of Nevada and western
Utah. From these highlands flowed great sluggish streams that carried
large amounts of sand and silt. Since the plains were almost flat,
swamps and small lakes were probably numerous. The streams may
have changed their courses from time to time as they were not confined
to deep valleys. When the whole region emerged from the sea
the climate became more humid. Volcanoes were active far to the
west; the winds carried clouds of ejected dust eastward and deposited
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
them on the plains. Semi-tropical conditions probably existed
throughout the United States and in parts of Canada. These deposits
are called the Morrison formation.</p>
<p>The warm humid climate provided ideal conditions for plant
growth. Great forests of lush vegetation covered the land. Many of
these plants have since disappeared, but some of their related species
may be found today in the tropics. Most of the plants of our Temperate
Zone had not yet evolved. However, there were tall stands of
a type of pine, and other evergreens. There were also gingkos and
curious tree ferns.</p>
<p>Various herb ferns formed a ground cover as thick and lush as grass
on a well-watered prairie. Palmlike ferns resembling today&rsquo;s cycads
were common, while along the river grew horsetail rushes like those
living today. Flowering plants of the Recent Epoch of geologic time
(in which we are now living) had not yet made their appearance.
Thus the hardwood, broadleaf forests of oak, elm, beech, maple, and
similar trees were absent. So too were the flowering shrubs familiar
to the Temperate Zone. Even the grasses were missing.</p>
<p>However, if you could picnic in this strange plant world you would
soon be slapping mosquitos and cursing the ants. For even in such
ancient times these insects were present; and so were a great variety
of other insects as is known from the more than 1,000 species that
have been discovered in Jurassic rocks. Among them were representatives
of most modern orders such as grasshoppers, beetles, moths, ants,
and flies. Jurassic insects probably looked much like those of today.</p>
<p>Among the most interesting of the strange reptiles were the
pterosaurs that dominated the skies. They resembled the modern bats
in some ways but their leathery wings were supported on each side
by one finger instead of four, and their skins were scaly or bare instead
of hairy. Some forms had long tails that were flattened at the
tip and helped them balance in flight, but others were tailless. Some
pterosaurs were no larger than sparrows while others had wing spans
of 3 to 4 feet.</p>
<p>Crocodiles sunned themselves on the banks of sluggish streams and
lakes. They probably looked a good deal like those that live in
modern swamps and their habits were similar. Many a small dinosaur
fell victim to their stealthy attack and disappeared beneath the
waters of some ancient stream.</p>
<p>Birds have been found in Upper Jurassic rocks of Germany and may
have lived here too. Their fossil remains would probably have been
classed as reptiles had not feather imprints been a part of them.
About the size of crows, these reptile-like birds had small conical teeth,
three-clawed fingers on each wing, and a long tail instead of the fan
of feathers seen on modern birds.</p>
<p>Small mammals were also living at the time the Morrison formation
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
was being deposited and their remains have been found in the
dinosaur quarry at Como Bluff, Wyo. The largest ones were about
the size of a house cat but the majority were much smaller, probably
about the size of today&rsquo;s mice.</p>
<p>We do not know much about the habits of these early mammals
but they were probably rather shy and retiring. This would be expected
in the world of giants where they lived. Some of them lived
in trees and there was one group whose skull characteristics resemble
those of the rodents. It is likely that these primitive mammals lived
a life similar to that of the rodents millions of years later.</p>
<p>This, then, was the setting, the stage upon which the dinosaurs
played their leading roles. Although we have restricted our discussion
to Morrison time in northeastern Utah, the same or similar animals
lived all over the world. Worldwide humid and mild climates
produced a similarity of plant and animal life during most of the
Mesozoic Era whose like has not been seen in the last 60 million
years. It was a strange world and ruled by strange animals, but it
must have been an interesting one.</p>
<h3 id="c10">HOW DO WE KNOW?</h3>
<p>This is a good time to stop and try to explain that this story, of
plants and animals of the past, has a firm foundation in today&rsquo;s facts&mdash;it
is not a fantasy.</p>
<p>The methods by which geologists and paleontologists have established
the age, climate, and life of Morrison time cannot be described
for you here in detail. To attempt such a description would require
too much space and would probably seem dull to most readers. Perhaps
the best approach is to describe some features and explain how
they contribute to our knowledge.</p>
<p>The rocks that were deposited here in Morrison time tell us much
of the story. The sandstones were once stream sandbars or perhaps
beaches around lakes. The shale, siltstone, and clay were muddy
stream or lake bottoms. The discontinuous ledges of conglomerate
probably represent gravel bars formed during flood stages or at places
where the stream currents were very swift.</p>
<p>Just rocks you may say&mdash;but look closely. A piece of sandstone
contains grains of sand that differ from each other in size, shape, and
composition. Frequently these characteristics point to the source of
the sandstone and tell something about the conditions at the time it
was deposited. Chunks of black material are examined closely and
prove to be charcoal&mdash;carbonized remains of plants.</p>
<p>Microscopic examination of clay fragments reveals shards of volcanic
glass and ash that speak of active volcanoes. Sometimes these
clays bear the carbonized imprints of delicate plants that long ago
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
sank to the bottom of some lake or stream where they were buried
and fossilized.</p>
<p>The fossils themselves are most important in reconstructing conditions
of the past. We find the shells of fresh-water clams in the sandstones
with dinosaur bones. Crocodile bones are also common. We
are reasonably sure, then, that these deposits of sand and mud were
formed in rivers and lakes when the climate was mild.</p>
<p>We reason by analogy. For example, fossil plants and animals have
counterparts or descendants in the world of today. We assume, in
the absence of contrary evidence, that the fossil animals lived like
their present-day counterparts. Although no birds, mammals, or
pterosaurs have been found in this quarry, they were probably living
here with the dinosaurs. It is possible, in fact probable, that some
modern animals and plants live in different environments than did
their Morrison ancestors and relatives but we have no way of knowing
which ones they were. We can only take the data available, arrange
them as logically as possible, and continue the search for more.
Some may scoff at such methods of reasoning yet they do provide
good results. What other methods can be used when the world
under investigation lies millions of years in the past?</p>
<h2 id="c11"><br /><span class="small">Animals from the Quarry</span></h2>
<p>In the rocks of the Morrison formation at the quarry, both orders
of dinosaurs are found&mdash;<i>Saurischia</i> and <i>Ornithischia</i>. Paleontologists
have divided the dinosaurs into these two groups on the basis of important
skeletal differences. These differences remain constant for the
orders and vary within each order only in small details.</p>
<p>The important structural difference in dinosaurs is found in the pelvis.
In all land vertebrates, the pelvis is made up of three pairs of
bones called the ilium, pubis, and ischium. The paired ilium is joined
to each side of the backbone and projects downward to meet the pubis
and ischium at the socket for the head of the thigh bone. The pubis
forms the front third and the ischium the rear third of this socket. In
the order <i>Saurischia</i> the bones of the pelvis are arranged as in most
reptiles and mammals. In the order <i>Ornithischia</i> the pubis extends
backward along the ischium as it does in the birds.</p>
<p>Two types of saurischian dinosaurs are found in the quarry. <i>Antrodemus</i>,
a flesh-eating type, was about the size of a horse, but was two-footed.
It had strong sharp claws on its feet. Its teeth were about
2 inches long, flattened from side to side and with fine serrations on
front and back edges. Actually it is not known whether <i>Antrodemus</i>
overpowered and killed the large swamp-living dinosaurs, or merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
fed on their carcasses after they had died from other causes. However,
there has been found in the quarries at Como, Wyo., a partial
skeleton of <i>Apatosaurus</i> with grooves on the bones which suggest
tooth marks. The spacing of these grooves fit the spacing of the
teeth of a specimen of <i>Antrodemus</i> found in the same quarry.</p>

<br />KEY: IL&mdash;ILLIUM; IS&mdash;ISCHIUM; P&mdash;PUBIS.</p>
</div>
<p>The plant-eating dinosaurs of the order <i>Saurischia</i> which are found
in the quarry were all four-footed. They had bodies about the size
of an elephant or larger. The principal differences between the flesh-
and plant-eating dinosaurs were the length of the neck and tail, the
details of their skull structure, and other parts of their skeleton.</p>
<p><i>Apatosaurus</i> is perhaps the most familiar dinosaur to most of us.
Its hind legs were much longer than its front ones and gave the animal
a high-hipped, stooped appearance. <i>Apatosaurus</i> was about 70
feet long and probably weighed close to 40 tons. <i>Diplodocus</i> was
longer (one of them 75&frac12; feet) but was slender and lightly built. Its
neck was longer and it had a whiplash tail that looked much like the
tail of the modern whiptailed lizard. <i>Diplodocus</i> also had long pencil-like
teeth different from those of any other known dinosaur. <i>Barosaurus</i>
has an extremely long neck with long individual neck bones.
Two members of the genus <i>Camarasaurus</i> are similar to each other except
for size; one was small, but the other was as large as <i>Apatosaurus</i>.
<i>Camarasaurus</i> had longer front legs than <i>Apatosaurus</i> and was generally
better proportioned.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Fossils of the saurischian plant-eaters are found much more frequently
than those of flesh-eaters and are usually in sedimentary rocks
which contain beds of clam shells. For this reason it seems probable
that they waded lagoons and streams, feeding on aquatic and bank-side
vegetation. The suggestion has been made that the larger dinosaurs
could not even walk on dry land because their weight would
have crushed the bones of their feet; they needed the buoyancy of
water to help support them. However, footprints of a huge dinosaur,
much larger than any from the quarry, have been found near Glenrose,
Tex. The large footprints were made on a sandy beach of a sea
in Lower Cretaceous time. Thus we know that they could walk on
dry land if they wanted to.</p>
<p>All of the dinosaurs of the order <i>Ornithischia</i> were plant-eaters, and
were of both two- and four-footed types. The two-footed types found
in the quarry are <i>Camptosaurus</i>, <i>Dryosaurus</i>, and <i>Laosaurus</i>. These
forms had well developed front legs, though much shorter than their
hind legs, which suggests that they may have dropped down on &ldquo;all
fours&rdquo; while feeding or resting. The teeth were small, chisel-shaped,
and fitted only for cropping vegetation. The larger specimens of
<i>Camptosaurus</i> reached a length of 17 feet but <i>Laosaurus</i> was only 2&frac12;
feet long.</p>
<p><i>Stegosaurus</i> is the only quadruped (four-footed) of this order found
in the quarry. It had long hind legs and very short front legs. It
reached a length of 18 to 20 feet and was 10 to 11 feet high over the
hips. The most characteristic feature of this form was the double
row of bony plates down the back and the group of spikes at the end
of the tail. The teeth were similar to those of <i>Camptosaurus</i>, but
much more numerous.</p>
<p>Only two other groups of reptiles have been found in the quarry at
Dinosaur National Monument and their remains are rare. These are
the crocodiles and turtles. Two crocodiles are known; the larger one,
<i>Goniopholis</i>, was about the size of existing alligators and did not differ
in external appearance from present-day crocodiles. The smaller one
was less than a foot long and resembled a 2 weeks&rsquo; old alligator as
much as anything. However, we know from the texture of the surface
of the bone that it was not a young animal. The turtle, <i>Glyptops</i>,
was about the same size and general appearance as the pond turtles of
today.</p>
<h3 id="c12">WHY SO MANY?</h3>
<p>The partial skeletons of more than 20 individual dinosaurs and the
scattered bones of about 300 more have been discovered in the Dinosaur
Quarry. Many of the best specimens may be seen today at
museums of natural history in the larger cities of the United States
and Canada. The quarry is easily the largest and best preserved deposit
of Jurassic dinosaurs known today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>How and why did so many dinosaur skeletons accumulate here?
How were they preserved? These are among the common questions
asked of park rangers and naturalists at Dinosaur. The answer is a
combination of circumstances and luck.</p>
<p>Many people get the impression from the mass of bones in the
quarry wall that some catastrophe such as a volcanic explosion or a
sudden flood killed a whole herd of dinosaurs in this area. True
enough this could have happened, but it probably did not. The main
reasons for thinking otherwise are the scattered bones and the thickness
of the deposit. In other deposits where the animals were thought
to have died together, the skeletons were usually complete and often
all the bones were in their proper positions, or articulated. In a mass
killing the bones would have been deposited on the stream or lake
bottom together at the same level, but in this deposit the bones occur
throughout a zone of sandstone about 12 feet thick. The mixture of
swamp dwellers and dry-land types also seems to indicate that the deposit
is a mixture derived from different sources. Rounded fragments
of fossil bone have been discovered in the quarry&mdash;fragments that attained
their pebblelike shape by rolling along the stream bottom.</p>
<p>If the mass of bones was not the result of catastrophe what did
happen? The quarry area is a dinosaur graveyard, not a place where
they died. A majority of the remains probably floated down an eastward
flowing river until they were stranded on a shallow sandbar.
Some of them, such as the stegosaurs, may have come from far-away
dryland areas to the west. Perhaps they drowned trying to ford a
tributary stream or were washed away during floods. Some of the
swamp dwellers may have mired down on the very sandbar that
became their grave while others may have floated for miles before being
stranded.</p>
<p>Even today similar events take place. When floods come in the
spring, sheep, cattle, and deer are often trapped by rising waters and
frequently drown. Their bloated carcasses float downstream until the
flood recedes and leaves them stranded on a bar or shore where they
lie, frequently half buried in the sand, until they decompose. Early
travelers on the Missouri River reported that shores and bars were
frequently lined with the decomposing bodies of bison that had perished
during spring floods.</p>
<p>In Dinosaur National Monument, the positions in which partial
skeletons of the dinosaurs lie suggest that they decomposed on a
sandbar. The bones on the underside of a skeleton are often arranged
as they were when the animal was alive, while those on the upper or
exposed side may be scattered. Such scattering would be expected as
the ligaments and muscles holding the bones together decomposed;
stream currents and scavengers could then disperse them. Stream
currents are suggested by the position of the long, flexible tails and
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
necks of the large plant feeders. These, like streaming water plants
in a river, trail downstream to the east.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c13">HOW WERE THEY PRESERVED?</h3>
<p>The concentration and burial of dinosaur bones is only the beginning
of the fossil story. The combination of circumstances which
operated here was a common one and yet fossil quarries are rare.
Why? The bones have to be preserved and this seldom happens.
The bones that are buried in one flood are frequently unearthed and
scattered by the next. Those that are exposed to the weather usually
disintegrate completely in a few years. The bones in the Dinosaur
Quarry did not.</p>
<p>Sometime after they were buried, the organic minerals of the bones
were more or less completely replaced by minerals of inorganic origin
such as silica. No one knows exactly why or how this happened, but
it did. Most geologists think this replacement process occurs when
subsurface or ground water containing soluble and colloidal minerals
dissolves a molecule of the bone and immediately replaces it with a
new mineral. Roughly such a process is like removing red bricks
from a house and substituting yellow. When the substitution is complete,
the house still has the same dimensions but it is composed of
different materials. The replacement was a faithful one, too, because
microscopic structure of the original bone was faithfully reproduced
by the replacing minerals.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Following Morrison time, thousands of feet of younger sediments
were deposited on the sandbar that contained the dinosaur bones.
The whole sequence of sediments was compacted into rock and some
bones were crushed and distorted.</p>
<h3 id="c14">HOW WERE THEY EXPOSED?</h3>
<p>After the sediments became rock and the bones had probably been
replaced by stone (fossilized), this part of the world, which lay near
or below sea level for millions of years, began to rise. Great forces
acted upon the earth&rsquo;s crust. These forces created faults, or fractures,
in the rock crust along which movement occurred. And what had
once been sea bottom was moved upward and became lofty mountains.
This titanic change has been called the Laramide Revolution;
it closed the Mesozoic Era with the formation of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Although the effects of the Laramide Revolution were not as profound
at Dinosaur as they were east of it, they were quite important.
The rocks were lifted to form the southwest flank of Split Mountain&mdash;a
small arch, or anticline, on the south side of the Uinta Mountains.
This mountain building explains the pronounced southward tilt of
the Dinosaur Ledge and other rock layers visible in the quarry area.
As the land rose, streams flowed more rapidly, cutting deeper into the
rocks and carrying away the debris. Gradually thousands of feet of
this debris&mdash;shale, sandstone, and clay&mdash;were stripped away through
erosion.</p>
<p>Finally all the material on top of the Morrison sandbar weathered
away. Some 140 million years after burial the fossil bones were
exposed by the agent that had buried them so long ago&mdash;running
water! All that remained was for them to be found, and that was the
luckiest chance of all. Just suppose they had been uncovered a million
years ago&mdash;only a second in geologic time. No one would have
been present to discover them, and through the years they could well
have crumbled into dust and been blown away.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><br /><span class="small">Why Did Dinosaurs Become Extinct?</span></h2>
<p>At Dinosaur National Monument only Morrison rocks of the upper
Jurassic Period contain the fossil bones of dinosaurs. After Morrison
time, the Cretaceous seas invaded this area. More than 5,000 feet of
sandstone, shale, and mudstone were formed from sediments deposited
in these seas.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in North America and the rest of the world, the diversity
and numbers of dinosaurs actually increased. Entirely new groups
evolved and achieved success in the battle for survival. The climax
of reptile development seems to have come near the end of Cretaceous
time in the Mesozoic Era. As the dinosaurs ruled the continents, so
did other strange reptiles dominate the seas. Had you been able to
see this ancient world, you would surely have been convinced that the
dinosaurs and other reptiles would rule forever.</p>
<p>But it was not to be. The dinosaur hordes were wiped out and the
reptiles reduced to the position of relative insignificance they occupy
today. Such a profound and sudden change in the evolutionary trend
of life must have had a cause, and scientists have sought it. Several
theories have been proposed to explain extinction of dinosaurs, and
they are most interesting.</p>
<p>At the end of Cretaceous time, some of our great mountain ranges
were formed. It was a time of earthquakes and of volcanoes that
belched forth clouds of ash and rivers of molten rock. Some people
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
would say these catastrophic events killed all the dinosaurs. The
scientist shakes his head. If these events killed dinosaurs, why not
the other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. And what of those
parts of the world that had no volcanoes, what killed dinosaurs there?</p>
<p>Changes in environments, the drainage of lakes and swamps as
young mountains rose, changes in vegetation as new plants replaced
old, and sudden shifts of climate occurred. These conditions could
explain local extinction, but there were places where these changes
did not occur and yet all dinosaurs in all places died.</p>
<p>A one-time favorite theory suggested that increasing numbers of
small mammals ate dinosaur eggs, but there were many mammals eating
dinosaur eggs during all of Cretaceous time and the dinosaur
hordes increased. Many more mammals during succeeding ages have
not killed off the turtles, snakes, lizards, and crocodiles that lay eggs
and exist in great numbers today.</p>
<p>Some disease or combination of plagues may have swept the dinosaurs
into extinction. If so, no evidence has been found to date that
confirms or denies. However, most paleontologists do not accept this
theory.</p>
<p>These are some of the theories that have been advanced to explain
the sudden extinction of dinosaurs throughout the world. Each
theory will explain the death of some dinosaurs in some places but
attempts to apply any of them, or combinations of them, to worldwide
extinction have failed.</p>
<p>This dinosaur story is like a mystery thriller with the last pages
torn out. A most important part is missing. That is true and the
paleontologist knows it. He also knows the riddle will probably
never be solved. He might point out, however, that no one has successfully
explained the extinction of the passenger pigeon which
occurred quite recently, nor do we know why some other species of
wildlife are on the brink of extinction today. The paleontologist is
not the only one who must say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br /><span class="small">History and Development of the Quarry</span></h2>
<h3 id="c17">DISCOVERY AND EARLY YEARS</h3>
<p>No one knows how long the old bones had been weathering out
of the hills of what is now Dinosaur National Monument before the
first man saw them. Curious Indians, wandering between the upturned
ridges of Mesozoic rocks, picked up fragments and carried them
off to their camps where they are now found among the arrow points,
ax heads, and corn-grinding stones. In 1776, the Spaniard, Father
Escalante, passed within sight of today&rsquo;s dinosaur quarry, not dreaming
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of the antiquity hidden there. Maj. John Wesley Powell, on his
second voyage down the Green River in 1871, recorded the presence
of &ldquo;reptilian remains&rdquo; in the area, but wrote nothing more about
them. Sheepherders, cattlemen, and hunters observed them and were
impressed in proportion to their understanding. But, through all the
years, the nature of the bones remained a mystery.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/pmg017.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="631" />
<p class="pcap">EARL DOUGLASS, DISCOVERER OF THE DINOSAUR QUARRY.</p>
</div>
<p>Then, in 1893, this mystery was solved. O. A. Peterson, a scientist
from the American Museum of Natural History, while conducting
field work in the Uinta Basin to the south of the present monument
boundaries, discovered bones out-cropping from a recognized fossil-bearing
stratum. The stratum was the 140,000,000 year-old Morrison
formation. The bones? Peterson reported them as the remains of
dinosaurs.</p>
<p>That report was to have an important influence, 15 years later, in
directing a fellow paleontologist from the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh
to investigate the area. Earl Douglass was the paleontologist&rsquo;s
name. In 1908, he and W. J. Holland, Director of the Carnegie
Museum, found themselves in the region of Peterson&rsquo;s discovery,
searching for dinosaur remains. They extended their search to the
north and thence along the Morrison hogback that flanks Split Mountain.
Bone was found&mdash;not much, but enough to bring Douglass
back the following summer and in company with George Goodrich,
a local resident, to pursue the hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The hunt came to a triumphant climax on August 17, 1909, when&mdash;to
quote from Douglass&rsquo;s diary&mdash;&ldquo;At last in the top of the ledge where
the softer overlying beds form a divide ... I saw eight of the tail
bones of a <i>Brontosaurus {Apatosaurus}</i> in exact position.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c18">STARTING THE QUARRY</h3>
<p>This was the beginning&mdash;the beginning of the celebrated dinosaur
quarry which was to yield such a multitude and variety of ancient
forms to science, and eventually lead to the establishment of Dinosaur
National Monument.</p>
<p>Douglass proceeded to dig into the solid rock along those original
eight tail bones and found other parts of the skeleton. In time, the
almost complete frame of the <i>Apatosaurus</i> was exposed. The skull
was missing and parts of the limb bones, but this was to be expected,
as fossil vertebrates are rarely preserved in their entirety. What was
not expected were the remains of a smaller dinosaur comingled with
those of its huge contemporary.</p>
<h3 id="c19">EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIND</h3>
<p>Douglass was elated. This was more than a &ldquo;one strike&rdquo;! How
much more, only further digging would tell. Sensing a large-scale
operation, he informed the Carnegie Museum of his prospects and
readied things with the intensity of a man at the gate of destiny.
From the neighboring ranches he recruited men, horses, and equipment.
He sent for his wife and child. He constructed a road to the
discovery site, built a five-room cabin out of logs and lumber, converted
a sheepherder&rsquo;s camp wagon into an office, selected ground for
future planting, bought a cow. A forge was set up. Tools were
purchased.</p>
<p>Back at the museum, Andrew Carnegie, himself, evinced interest.
He had always wanted something &ldquo;as big as a barn&rdquo; for his institution.
A special annual field fund of $5,000 was added to the regular
budget to carry on the work.</p>
<p>Within a year, Douglass and his men had run a cut over a hundred
feet long in the hard sandstone, digging down along the almost perpendicular
slant of the rock. At the base of this, rails were laid and
small mine carts introduced to haul away the cuttings from the
rapidly developing quarry.</p>
<p>New specimens appeared: A small plant-eating dinosaur known as
<i>Dryosaurus</i>; an armored form called <i>Stegosaurus</i>; and another large creature
like the <i>Apatosaurus</i>. Best of all, the <i>Apatosaurus</i> No. 1 was well
on its way out of the rock and would soon be ready to ship to the
Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In 1913, after 3 years of laboratory work in the Carnegie Museum
the big <i>Apatosaurus</i> was on its feet in the Hall of Vertebrate Paleontology&mdash;1
of the 4 mounted specimens of this genus in the country
and the most perfect of all. Prepared and erected by Arthur S.
Coggeshall and his associates, it measures 71&frac12; feet long and stands
15 feet tall at the arch of the back.</p>
<p>As the excavating progressed it was not long before the diggings
became what is known to the profession as a &ldquo;general quarry.&rdquo;
Dinosaurs of &ldquo;all kinds and sizes&rdquo; were showing up. Other quarries
of this type had been developed in previous years in the Morrison
formation at Como Bluff, Wyo., and Canon City, Colo., but they contained
nothing like the variety of forms found here. Moreover, these
at the monument were better preserved and the skeletons more intact.</p>
<p>The remains most frequently encountered in the diggings were those
of sauropods&mdash;the huge plant-feeding dinosaurs with long tapering
extremities that lumbered about on four pillar-like legs. <i>Camarasaurus</i>
and the larger <i>Apatosaurus</i> were typical members of this group, and
their numerous bones show them as being common animals of their
time.</p>
<p>More common were the <i>Diplodoci</i>, of the exaggerated neck and even
longer whiplash tail. This genus distinguished itself by producing not
only the largest amount of skeletal material from the quarry, but
also the largest number of skulls&mdash;those rarest of fossils. One skull
was found in exact position with the neck bones, which settled all
doubts as to the details of this animal&rsquo;s head piece. The longest
<i>Diplodocus</i> to come from the monument extended 75&frac12; feet.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the diminutive <i>Laosaurus</i>, a 2&frac12;-foot biped which
ranks as the smallest dinosaur yet taken from the deposit. This tiny
creature had hollow limb bones and was one of the agile, quick-running
types. Only one was found. When discovered, Douglass
thought it a &ldquo;baby&rdquo; dinosaur, but study proved it to be a full-grown
specimen. The condition of the skeleton reflected considerable agitation
before and after burial. It lay on its back, the limbs distended.
The tail was gone and the skull crushed.</p>
<p>In many respects, the most interesting dinosaur found was the
sauropod, <i>Barosaurus</i>. It was an extremely long-necked form, some
of the individual cervical vertebrae measuring 3 feet in length. Two
specimens were excavated.</p>
<p>The flesh-eaters, as might be expected from their scarcity in other
localities, made but a small showing. Two specimens of <i>Antrodemus</i>
were unearthed. Thirty feet long, this animal was the ranking predator
of its day, although hardly comparable to the towering <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
that entered upon the earthly scene at a later age.</p>
<p><i>Stegosaurus</i> remains&mdash;so abundant that Douglass grew tired of
them&mdash;added a bizarre note. An armored form, it was equipped with
a frill of bony plates that extended the length of the back and terminated
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
in a pair of sharp spines. Its chief claim to fame rests in its
supposed two sets of &ldquo;brains,&rdquo; one a motor-control center situated in
the hip region, and the other in the usual place.</p>
<p>Everywhere they dug, the excavators found fresh material&mdash;a vast
jumble of bones so concentrated and intermingled as to make it difficult
to distinguish one specimen from another. Douglass was amazed.
Obviously, it was not with animals of a single area that he was dealing,
but of an entire region. He was dealing with a dinosaur <i>fauna</i>.
He was also perplexed. How did so many different types happen to
occur in one small locality?</p>
<p>Slowly, as Douglass&rsquo;s acquaintance with the deposit grew, the answer
came. It was, he reasoned, the work of a river. The sandstones
were ancient sediments. In their structure and composition lay
the story of swift swirling currents. The coarse granular texture told
of fast water; the crossbedding, of shifting channels; the grouping of
the bones into clusters, of eddies.</p>
<p>It all added up to an old delta deposit at the mouth of a river, a
region of bars where the carcasses of dinosaurs brought down stream
accumulated. Settling, the great hulks became buried as they sank
into the receptive sand. A number of carcasses multiplied ... and
slowly, as flesh and ligament decayed, the bones became mingled,
eventually to petrify and remain preserved through the ages.</p>
<h3 id="c20">WORK METHODS</h3>
<p>At the quarry, excavating continued summer and winter. The
methods employed were those that paleontologists had used for
decades. There was no compressed air, no labor-saving devices. The
work was done by hand. The crew, which seldom exceeded four men
at any one time, became veterans in the art of fossil extraction. The
bone was brittle; the encasing sandstone, hard. It required toil,
patient direction, and a knowledge of anatomy.</p>
<p>Judiciously placed charges of giant powder shattered the overburden.
Hand drills, wedge-and-feather, and crowbar worked the
rock away, until the bone layer was encountered. The slow attrition
by hammer and chisel accomplished the final delicate separation of
the remains from the enclosing matrix. Team-and-scraper and small
handcarts removed the rubble that swiftly accumulated in the cut. As
the bones were chiseled from the quarry face in large blocks of rock,
they were encased in strips of burlap dipped in flour paste. (Later,
plaster of Paris supplanted the flour paste.) Then they were lowered
by rope onto a mule-drawn skid and &ldquo;snaked&rdquo; down the trail into the
gulch to await boxing.</p>

<p>Transporting the fossils from quarry to railhead was a major undertaking.
It required wagon trains&mdash;4-horse teams hauling high-wheeled
freight wagons over 60 miles of rutted roads to Dragon, Utah. There
the precious goods were loaded onto boxcars of the now abandoned
narrow gauge Uintah Railway, later to be transhipped to the standard
gauge Denver &amp; Rio Grande line at Mack, Colo.</p>
<h3 id="c21">FURTHER DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>Specimens continued to show in record abundance, most of them
duplicating the earlier finds of <i>Diplodocus</i> and <i>Stegosaurus</i>. But there
were new forms, too. One of them was a <i>Camptosaurus</i>, the first to
be found at the quarry. It was a modified biped of plant-eating habits,
a little more than 10 feet long, with its skull and part of the tail
missing.</p>
<p>By 1921 the deposit had been worked to a length of 400 feet east
and west, and to a depth of about 60 feet. Rock was being stripped
from the quarry face at the rate of approximately 20,000 cubic feet
annually, and the chisels of Douglass and his men had penetrated to
the richest bone-bearing zone.</p>
<p>In the following year they uncovered one of the most perfect skeletons
of a dinosaur ever exhumed. It was a small sauropod named,
<i>Camarasaurus lentus</i>. When found, its 17-foot vertebral column was
practically intact, except for a few tail segments. The skull was in
place, and the limbs in their approximate positions.</p>
<p>It was an important find scientifically. The position of the limbs
gave clear evidence of the manner in which these animals carried themselves.
The articulation between the thigh bone and the pelvis
showed conclusively that sauropods walked with their legs more-or-less
vertical to the body and not with the bowed-out crawling posture
habitual to lizards, as many scientists had supposed. The skull was
the finest known for this genus. It was complete even to the sclerotic
ring&mdash;a complex of bony plates which surrounded the living eye and
protected it.</p>
<p>As exhibit material it was without rival. It was mounted as found,
lying on its side, the bones fixed in death in the matrix in which they
had been preserved&mdash;a fitting climax to the 13 consecutive years that
had seen an unknown sandstone ridge in Utah become Dinosaur
National Monument.</p>
<p>In those 13 years the Carnegie Museum had taken from the quarry
parts of 300 dinosaur specimens, 2 dozen of which were mountable
skeletons. Ten different species were represented. It was the best
collection of Middle Mesozoic monsters in the world.</p>
<p>In the years that immediately followed, the still-rich &ldquo;dig&rdquo; was
worked by two other organizations&mdash;the Smithsonian Institution and
the University of Utah.</p>

</div>
<p>But finally the museums had reaped their harvest. The fruits of
the harvest had gone to enrich many of their finest displays. However,
still buried in the untouched part of the wall were the remains
of still more dinosaurs. All that was needed was to reveal them.
The 67&deg; tilt of the rock made it a perfect exhibit face. Strip off the
overlying layers, expose the skeletons, and relief them in place. This
had been Douglass&rsquo;s idea as far back as 1915, when he recorded it in
his diary.</p>
<h3 id="c22">PROTECTING THE QUARRY</h3>
<p>But Douglass was not the only one to realize the necessity of preserving
this unique fossil record of the dinosaurs for people of today
and the future to see on the spot. Officials of the Carnegie Museum
realized the extraordinary nature of the deposits and their contribution
to our knowledge of the past; and they were not long in taking
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
steps to protect the dinosaur quarry. To preserve it for science, they
sought to lay claim to it as a mineral property. But their claim was
disallowed by the U. S. Department of the Interior, because fossil
bones could not be classed as a mineral within the meaning of the
mining laws.</p>
<p>The museum pressed its case, this time with results&mdash;but not what
they expected. The outcome was not the establishment of a mere
mineral claim, but of a national monument. Under the provisions
of the Antiquities Act, to safeguard and preserve objects and areas of
significant scientific or historic interest, the dinosaur quarry and 80
acres of surrounding land were declared a national monument on
October 4, 1915. Less than a year later it was included in the newly
created National Park System.</p>
<p>Several things contributed notably to this action to protect the
quarry. They were: the exceptional preservation of the bones; the
number, variety and completeness of the skeletons; the relative abundance
of skulls, consisting of 8 or more in a complete state, and about
an equal number of incomplete ones; and the finding of the first complete
tails.</p>
<p>In 1923, knowing that the quarry was protected, and that the scientific
collection of the fossil bones for museum exhibit was at an end,
Earl Douglass turned again to the idea of making a perfected exhibit
of the fossils right where they lie. His letter to Dr. Walcott, secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, reads, in part, &ldquo;I hope that the
Government, for the benefit of science and the people, will uncover a
large area, leave the bones and skeletons in relief and house them in.
It would make one of the most astounding and instructive sights
imaginable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">ARCHITECT&rsquo;S DRAWING OF VISITOR CENTER AT QUARRY SITE.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>This is precisely what the Government had in mind and, through
the agency of the National Park Service, intended to accomplish.
Plans for an in-place exhibit were drawn up. But many years were to
elapse before the plans passed from blueprint into reality.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the quarry entered the second phase of its existence,
a dormant period from a scientific viewpoint, but one in which
the forces of the future gathered ground.</p>
<p>During the 1930&rsquo;s the monument served as a transient camp. A. C.
Boyle was installed as resident geologist and custodian for the Park
Service. Under his guidance a program for the general development
of the area was carried on, financed largely by WPA funds. This entailed,
among other things, the deepening and widening of the quarry
cut, and the construction of buildings later to accommodate the monument
staff and exhibits.</p>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History became interested in the
development at this time and, through its curator of fossil reptiles,
Barnum Brown, sought to initiate a joint effort with the Park Service
for exhibiting the quarry remains.</p>
<h3 id="c23">PRESENT DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>It was not until September 1953 that the years of Park Service planning
bore fruit, and the work of developing an in-place exhibit for
the monument was begun. Many factors operated to spring the project
into being, not the least of which was the active interest and
wholehearted support of Horace M. Albright, a former Director of
the Service.</p>
<p>Theodore E. White, formerly with the Smithsonian Institution and
with Harvard University, was placed in immediate charge, under the
supervision of Jess H. Lombard, the superintendent of the National
Monument. His task, and that of his associates, was to expose the
remaining specimens in the quarry wall and work them out in bas-relief.</p>
<p>A shelter had been built over the working space and power tools
were introduced for the first time. Using compressed air, the rock
was scaled off with jackhammers and &ldquo;paving-breakers,&rdquo; until most of
the overburden had been removed. Subsequent probing into the bone
layer was done with smaller chipping hammers, mallet, and chisel.
This operation continued through 1954 and 1955 as, slowly and carefully,
the extent of the skeletal material was determined. It comprised
parts of several large dinosaurs, sufficient in quantity to justify the
next step&mdash;the construction of a building to enclose the quarry face.</p>
<p>Erection of this unusual structure, the first of its design to be attempted,
commenced in 1957 and it was opened to the public in the
following year. Now, as one of the many development projects in its
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
MISSION 66 program, the National Park Service has resumed the
delicate work of uncovering this corner of the ancient world and preserving
it in-place for all time.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><br /><span class="small">The Scene Today</span></h2>
<p>If you stand at the overlook, you will see the Green River, Split
Mountain, and a rolling plain to the south that stretches to a hazy
line of mountains. To many, it is an unfamiliar land that lies strangely
subdued beneath a blazing sun and an intensely blue sky.</p>
<p>That blue sky is the key to the kinds of plants and animals that live
in this part of the monument. They live most of their lives under
blue sky, and, even when clouds do form over the mountains and drift
across the lowlands, the results are disappointing. A high wind, dust
and sand, a few drops of rain, and the storm is over.</p>
<p>The climatic conditions under which local plants and animals live
are conditions of extremes. On summer days the temperatures may
rise above 100&deg;, although the nights are usually cool. During the
winter, temperatures may skid to 30&deg; below zero or more. It is not
uncommon for the thermometer to remain below zero for weeks on
end. But the most influential climatic factor is water&mdash;and there is
little of it. The total yearly precipitation is a little less than 8 inches!
It is interesting then to find such a wide variety of plants and animals
that not only survive but flourish under such rigorous conditions.</p>
<p>The methods used by plants in adapting to arid conditions are interesting
and varied. The wide-spreading, shallow root system and
thick stem of the cactus enhance collection and storage of water.
These strange plants are quite plump with stored water in the spring
when the snows melt, but they gradually lose this plumpness during
the dry summer, and by autumn many seem lifeless.</p>
<p>Other plants conserve their water by minimizing the loss through
their leaves. This may be done in a number of ways. The leaves of
the spiny greasewood are covered with a waxy substance that inhibits
water loss while the leaves of the sagebrush are covered with hairs or
fuzz that serve the same function. The leaves of the juniper are scale-like
and really don&rsquo;t look like leaves at all. The most direct method
of preventing water loss through leaves is to drop the leaves themselves,
and this method is used to a greater or lesser degree by many
desert plants. The serviceberry is a good example of this method. In
late summer it looks dead, and yet the following spring finds it robed
in green and covered with flowers.</p>
<p>In contrast to the frugal habits of the plants just described, the cottonwoods
seem lavish indeed. Usually big trees, they spread a canopy
of green in whose shade rest birds and animals alike. Have you ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
rested under a cottonwood? If so, you will remember it as being cool
even on the hottest days. Part of the coolness was due to the hundreds
of gallons of water which are transpired through the leaves each
day. Because cottonwoods require so much water, they usually grow
along streams or near springs. Frequently they are seen along dry
ravines where their thirsty roots tap the subsurface drainage that lies
hidden below. Like the other plants however, when the supply of
water becomes inadequate they shed their leaves and wait for the next
spring. Fast growing, usually of large size, and wasteful of water
where water is dear, the cottonwood seldom lives two hundred years
while the twisted juniper on the dry, rocky ledge frequently lives as
much as five hundred.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/pmg026.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="463" />
<p class="pcap">SPLIT MOUNTAIN GORGE.</p>
</div>
<p>Inconspicuous through most of the year are the flowering plants.
Some of these are annuals&mdash;plants that grow from seeds, mature,
bloom, produce seeds, and die in the span of a few short weeks.
When the snows melt and the sun warms the earth, the seeds that
survived the winter germinate. The usually barren hillsides produce
spots of green that soon spread to form patches as more and more
plants mature. Lupine and locoweed are purple and heliotrope splashes
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
color along the roads, while the fragrant, white, evening-primrose dots
the sandy hillside. Scarlet gilia and Indian paintbrush add a touch of
red to the scene, and orange is provided by the mallow.</p>
<p>April, May, and early June provide the best flower show as spring
rains supplement the moisture from melted snow. Their races won,
their seeds produced, the annuals wither and fade away as the temperatures
rise. By the first of July little remains of the splendid show.</p>
<p>Two plants do brighten the desert scene in August and September.
Most common is the rabbitbrush, a plant that grows almost everywhere.
It is rather inconspicuous except in late summer when its
brilliant yellow blossoms turn the whole shrub golden. The other is
the bee plant of which there are two species: one has yellow blossoms,
and the other has purple. These tall plants grow along washes,
stream courses, roads, and irrigation ditches. Their delicate blossoms
are always surrounded by insects drawn by the nectar the flowers produce
in great quantities.</p>
<p>These, then, are a few of the typical plants. Each has adjusted its
needs to those limiting factors&mdash;winter cold, summer heat, and aridity.
A great number of plants grow on the monument that have not been
mentioned here, but they are like the typical plants and have similar
ways of meeting the problems of survival.</p>
<p>Many people who profess an interest in nature admit they cannot
get very excited about plants. Such disinterest may result in minimizing
the importance of plants in the general scheme of nature.
That would be a major error. The plants of the world are the foundation
upon which other forms of life are dependent. They alone are
able to utilize the minerals in the soil and convert carbon dioxide and
water to carbohydrates. Because of these abilities, the parade of life
has been able to advance only when the plants advance. In the present
as in the past, the kinds and abundance of plants set definite limits
as to the species and numbers of animals an area may support. Thus,
if man changes the plants of an area he will surely change the animals
too, whether he realizes it or not.</p>
<p>If you drive to the quarry in the heat of the day you will see only
a few of the birds that live here. They don&rsquo;t like to hunt their food
during those hot hours. Frequently a turkey vulture sails majestically
above the plains along the Green River. Sometimes so high he appears
to be a speck, his telescopic eye searches the ground for the carrion
upon which he feeds. Another bird that does not mind the heat
is Say&rsquo;s phoebe. He is usually found perched on a fence post, a wire,
or a dead branch waiting for some insect to buzz by. A graceful,
short flight, a pop of his beak, and then back to his perch to repeat
the cycle again. As he sits motionless, his gray breast and darker gray
head and back make him hard to see.</p>
<p>The time to watch birds is in the evening; as the sun sinks and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
air cools, they come forth. Small gray-brown rock wrens hop among
the boulders near the visitor center. Robins scurry through the leaves
in the stream course below the Dinosaur Quarry. Here too, western
flycatchers and Audubon&rsquo;s warblers search among the cottonwoods for
insects. A flash of red and white is seen as a red-shafted flicker darts
from its nest in the hollow trunk of a tree. The sky is filled with
wheeling, twittering rough-winged swallows and white-throated swifts
that descend from their nests on the cliffs to feed upon the gnats and
other flying insects.</p>
<p>These are the birds that spend the spring and summer here. They
raise their families and, young and old alike, depart in autumn when
frost kills the insects upon which they feed. As they flee the cold of
winter, they are joined by many other birds that make their summer
homes at higher elevations or more northern latitudes. Ducks, geese,
and swans join the hordes moving southward. So do the various
shore birds, bluebirds, and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>But the sagebrush flats and brushy ravines are not left vacant by
this wholesale migration, for as the summer residents move out the
winter residents move in. The Oregon and gray-headed juncos spend
the entire winter here. Great flocks of mountain bluebirds descend
from the mountains and pi&ntilde;on jays make the hills resound with their
screams. Canada geese and golden-eye ducks live on the Green River
and remain until it freezes. The harsh croak of the raven is seldom
heard in summer but often in winter.</p>
<p>Few birds live here in winter and summer&mdash;the golden and bald
eagles, the red-tailed hawk, and the little sparrow hawk. Perhaps the
most handsome year-round resident is the magpie with its long, iridescent
tail, black and white body, and white patches on its wings.
One other resident makes his presence known by his eerie cry on
frosty, moonlit nights&mdash;the western horned owl. He hunts every
night, summer and winter, but is seldom seen. Occasionally he is
disturbed upon his daylight roost and as he skillfully dodges through
the junipers, he makes a joke of the story that owls don&rsquo;t see well in
daylight.</p>
<p>The mammals that live in the vicinity of the Dinosaur Quarry are
almost never seen. There are several reasons for this&mdash;almost all of
them are nocturnal, are very shy, and most of them are small.</p>
<p>In spite of their retiring habits, they reveal their presence in a number
of ways. Patches of bare earth under sagebrush and nearby sandy
slopes are crisscrossed with tiny paths beaten into the dust by deer
mice. Along the river bank, gnawed tree stumps, a few fresh chips,
and perhaps a webbed footprint tell us beaver have been active during
the night. The paired hind footprints of the kangaroo rat are
common on the hillside. Freshly fallen snow records the preceding
night&rsquo;s activities in perfect detail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/pmg027.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="541" />
<p class="pcap">GOLDEN-MANTLED GROUND SQUIRREL</p>
</div>
<p>Were it not for the golden-mantled ground squirrels, our evidence
of mammals would be mostly indirect. But these little fellows are
very much in evidence all day long as they play around the visitor
center and in the picnic areas. They are handsome too, with their
alert black eyes, cinnamon neck and shoulders, and dark side patches
with white stripes. Most people call these ground squirrels chipmunks
because both are striped. Actually the two are easy to tell
apart; the chipmunk&rsquo;s stripes run to the tip of its nose, but those of
the golden-mantled ground squirrel extend forward only to the shoulder
region. Any small, striped mammal seen near the quarry is probably
a ground squirrel, as chipmunks are rare here.</p>
<p>The water problem is an ever-present one for the mammals as well
as the plants. At first this may seem strange with the Green River
so close and several springs in the hills, but most of the smaller animals
have very restricted ranges. A deer mouse, for example, seldom
travels more than 100 feet from his home burrow in his entire lifetime.
The kangaroo rat and the desert woodrat also have limited
ranges although theirs are somewhat larger than those of deer mice.
The majority of such animals must meet their water needs without
springs and seeps. How do they do it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>

<p class="pcap">BADGER. (COURTESY, U. S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.)</p>
</div>
<p>The food they eat contains some water. The green vegetation of
springtime contains large amounts. Even air-dried foods such as seeds
contain some. And these animals don&rsquo;t need much. Through the
thousands of years these little creatures have lived in arid lands, evolutionary
processes have altered their bodies and life patterns to fit the
conditions under which they must live. Surely one of the most useful
and interesting of their abilities is that of utilizing metabolic water.
Such water is obtained through oxidation of hydrogen contained in
food and is a by-product of metabolism. Putting it another way, during
the digestive process these animals are able to manufacture water
from the chemical constituents of their food and the oxygen in their
blood. The amount of water thus obtained is between 70 and 100
percent of the dry weight of the food eaten. Thus some desert animals
are able to live a normal life span without ever taking a drink,
and probably many of them do.</p>
<p>Carnivores such as the badger and the coyote get some of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
water from the animals they eat and may go for days without visiting
a spring. But eventually they return to the river or a spring for a
drink. This is no special effort as carnivores generally range for miles
in search of prey.</p>
<p>Winter is a time of difficulty for most animals. Some of them like
the ground squirrels hibernate and sleep the winter away, but the majority
must rustle their &ldquo;daily bread.&rdquo; Winter storms drive the mule
deer down from the high country. Mice tunnel through the snow in
search of food. The white-tailed jackrabbit and the snowshoe hare
change their coats from brown to white. In particularly hard winters
the animals die in great numbers, first the weak and old, then the
young, and sometimes even animals in prime condition fail to survive.</p>
<p>The reptiles that make their homes in the Quarry Area of Dinosaur
National Monument are few in number. The rattlesnake is rare and
seldom seen. The only common snake is the bull or gopher snake.
This snake can appear very threatening as it swells its body and hisses
loudly, but it is not poisonous. Gopher snakes climb well and are
often seen in trees where they hunt for eggs and young birds.</p>
<p>Two lizards are commonly seen here during the summer. The side-blotched
lizard is about 1&frac34; to 2&#8539; inches long with a somewhat
longer tail. These small brown lizards are frequently seen among the
rocks near the parking and picnic areas. The name, side-blotched
lizard, is taken from the black or bluish-black area behind the foreleg
of the males. These lizards are also called brown utas.</p>
<p>The western whiptail is also a very common lizard. As its name
suggests, it has a very long slender tail which it lashes from side to
side as it runs. This lizard is easily distinguished from the side-blotched
lizard by its larger size, longer more slender tail, and the
presence of bars and spots of black upon its back. In late summer,
junior-sized young whiptails appear, but their 3-inch total length is
unimpressive compared to 8-inch adults. The young are quite handsome
with pleasing body colors and bright-blue tails.</p>
<p>Often lizards are seen whose tails are missing. When the tail is
pulled or injured it can be shed by its owner. The shed tail may wriggle
for several minutes and attract the predator&rsquo;s attention while the lizard
escapes. The tailless lizard soon grows another one that is usually
recognizable by its subdued or otherwise different color pattern. Sometimes
the broken tail does not fall off so it and the new tail form a fork.</p>
<p>In summary then, we see that this apparently lifeless desert does
support a wide variety of living things and a great number of individuals.
Some of them, the plants and small animals, live here all
year round while others, such as most birds, live here only part of the
time. But whatever the length of stay, all living things must adapt
themselves to existing conditions at the time of their stay. If they
cannot adapt to static or changing conditions they must move or become
extinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Some 60 million years have passed since the dinosaurs ruled the
world. In that time mountains have risen, wasted away, and risen
again. Glaciers have come and gone. Many species of plants and
animals evolved and passed on to extinction. Every life form meets
the test&mdash;adapt or die. That test is as real to the dusty lizard basking
on the quarry face as it was to the dinosaurs whose bones you came
to see.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
